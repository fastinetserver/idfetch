[network_bind]
# BIND INTERFACE / IP
# Pass a string as parameter. This sets the interface name to use as outgoing 
# network interface. The name can be an interface name, an IP address, or a host 
# name. No binding is set by default.
# Default:
# bind_interface=none
bind_interface=none

# BIND LOCALPORT
# Pass a long. This sets the local port number of the socket used for connection.
# This can be used in combination with BIND_INTERFACE and you are recommended to
# use BIND_LOCALPORTRANGE as well when this is set.
# Valid port numbers are 1 - 65535.

# BIND_LOCALPORTRANGE
# Pass a long. This is the number of attempts segget should make to find a 
# working local port number. It starts with the given BIND_LOCALPORT and adds 
# one to the number for each retry. Setting this to 1 or below will make segget 
# do only one try for the exact port number. Port numbers by nature are scarce 
# resources that will be busy at times so setting this value to something too 
# low might cause unnecessary connection setup failures. 

[network_connections]
# NETWORK_MAX_CONNECTIONS
# Define maximum number of connections
# Minimum value: 1
# Maximum value: 20
# Default:
# max_connections=10
max_connections=3

# CONNECTION_TIMEOUT
# Set the number of seconds to wait while trying to connect. Use 0 to wait 
# indefinitely. Pass a long. It should contain the maximum time in seconds that 
# you allow the connection to the server to take. This only limits the connection
# phase, once it has connected, this option is of no more use. Set to zero to 
# disable connection timeout (it will then only timeout on the system's internal 
# timeouts). See also the TIMEOUT option.
# Minimum value: 1
# Maximum value: 1000
# Default:
# connection_timeout=15
connection_timeout=15

# FTP_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT
# Set a timeout period (in seconds) on the amount of time that the server is 
# allowed to take in order to generate a response message for a command before the
# session is considered hung. While awaiting for a response, this value overrides 
# TIMEOUT. It is recommended that if used in conjunction with TIMEOUT, you set 
# FTP_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT to a value smaller than TIMEOUT.
# Minimum value: 1
# Maximum value: -1 (for no limit)
# Default:
# ftp_response_timeout=180
ftp_response_timeout=180

# TIMEOUT
# maximum amount of time to download segment in seconds
# Set the maximum number of seconds for a connection to execute.
# Pass a long as parameter containing the maximum time in seconds that you allow 
# the transfer operation to take. Normally, name lookups can take a considerable 
# time and limiting operations to less than a few minutes risk aborting perfectly
# normal operations.
# Minimum value: 100
# Maximum value: -1 (for no limit)
# Default:
# timeout=500
timeout=500

# LOW_CONNECTION_SPEED_LIMIT
# Define the low speed limit for connection. Pass a long as parameter. It 
# contains the transfer speed in bytes per second that the transfer should be 
# below during LOW_CONNECTION_SPEED_TIME seconds to consider it too slow and abort.
# Minimum value: 1
# Maximum value: -1 (-1 for no limit)
# Default:
# low_connection_speed_limit=1000
low_connection_speed_limit=1000

# LOW_CONNECTION_SPEED_TIME
# Pass a long as parameter. It contains the time in seconds that the transfer 
# should be below the LOW_CONNECTION_SPEED_LIMIT to consider it too slow and abort.
# Minimum value: 1
# Maximum value: 600
# Default:
# low_connection_speed_time=10
low_connection_speed_time=10

# MAX_CONNECTION_SPEED
# If a download exceeds this speed (counted in bytes per second) on cumulative 
# average during the transfer, the transfer will pause to keep the average rate 
# less than or equal to the parameter value. Defaults to unlimited speed.
# Minimum value: 1
# Maximum value: -1 (-1 for no limit)
# Default:
# max_connection_speed=0
max_connection_speed=3000

[network_protocols]
# SYNOPSIS: http_on=0 | 1
# Default: 
# http_on=1
# NOT IMPLEMENTED YET: http_on=1

# SYNOPSIS: ftp_on=0 | 1
# Default: 
# ftp_on=1
# NOT IMPLEMENTED YET: ftp_on=1

[network_user_data]
# USER_AGENT
# Set the User-Agent: header in the http request sent to the remote server. 
# This can be used to fool servers or scripts.
# Default:
# user_agent=segget
user_agent=segget

# Specify the user and password for authentication on a ftp servers.
# NOT IMPLEMENTED YET: ftp-user=anonymous
# NOT IMPLEMENTED YET: ftp-password=me@mail.ru

[network_proxy]
# PROXY_IP_OR_NAME
# Specify a proxy to use (address and port).
# Set HTTP proxy to use. The parameter should be a string holding the proxy host
# name or dotted IP address. To specify port number in this string, 
# append :[port] to the end of the host name. The proxy string may be prefixed 
# with [protocol]:// since any such prefix will be ignored. The proxy's port 
# number may optionally be specified with the separate option. If not specified,
# by default port 1080 will be used for proxies.
# When you tell segget to use an HTTP proxy, segget will transparently convert 
# operations to HTTP even if you specify an FTP URL etc.
# Segget respects the environment variables http_proxy, ftp_proxy, all_proxy etc,
# if any of those are set. The PROXY option does however override any possibly 
# set environment variables.
# Default:
# proxy_ip_or_name=none
proxy_ip_or_name=none

# PROXY_PORT
# Set the proxy port to connect to unless it is specified in the PROXY option.
# Minimum value: 1
# Maximum value: 65535
# Default:
# proxy_port=3128
proxy_port=3128

# PROXY_USER
# Set user name to use for the transfer while connecting to Proxy.
# The PROXY_USER option should be used in same way as the PROXY_PASSWORD is used.
# In order to specify the password to be used in conjunction with the user name
# use the PROXY_PASSWORD option.
# Default:
# proxy_user=none
proxy_user=none

# PROXY_PASSWORD
# Set password to use for the transfer while connecting to Proxy.
# The PROXY_PASSWORD option should be used in conjunction with the PROXY_USER 
# option.
# Default:
# proxy_password=none
proxy_password=none

# SYNOPSIS: proxy_off=0 | 1
# Setting the proxy_off=1 will explicitly disable the use of a proxy, even if 
# there is an environment variable set for it.
# Default:
# proxy_off=1
proxy_off=1

[network_mirrors]
# SYNOPSIS: NETWORK_USES_OWN_MIRROR_LIST_ONLY_ON=0 | 1
# - If set to 1, segget will replace mirror list provided by portage system with
# the list from network1_mirrors.conf
# - If set to 0, segget will use ONLY mirror list provided by portage system, 
# and will NOT use the list from network1_mirrors.conf file
# Default:
# use_own_mirror_list_only_on=0
use_own_mirror_list_only_on=1

# SYNOPSIS: ONLY_LOCAL_WHEN_POSSIBLE=0 | 1
# If NETWORK_USES_OWN_MIRROR_LIST_ONLY_ON=0 this option will be ignored.
# - If set to 1, segget will not use remote mirrors with equal or lower priority
# until all mirrors in network0_mirrors.conf file have failed.
# - If set to 0, segget will use remote mirrors with equal priority or mirrors 
# with lower priority when this network has NO free connections (see option 
# NETWORK_MAX_CONNECTIONS in [network_connections] section of this file).
# Default:
# only_local_when_possible=1
only_local_when_possible=1
