# DISTFILES_DIR
# Define a dir to store distfiles
# Default:
# distfiles_dir=./distfiles
distfiles_dir=./distfiles

# SEGMENTS_DIR
# Define a dir to store distfiles' segments
# Default:
# segments_dir=./tmp
segments_dir=./tmp

[portage]
# SYNOPSIS: fetch_only=0 | 1
# NOT IMPLEMENTED YET: fetch_only=0

[distfiles]
# MAX_CONNECTION_NUM_PER_DISTFILE
# Each distfile can have up to max_connection_num_per_distfile simultaneous
# connections.
# default:
# max_connection_num_per_distfile=3
max_connection_num_per_distfile=3

[segments]
# MAX_SEGMENT_SIZE
# Define maximum segment size in bytes.
# Default:
# max_segment_size=500000
max_segment_size=500000

# SYNOPSIS: resume_on=0 | 1
# - If resume_on set to 1:
# Before starting downloading a segment segget checks whether this segment is 
# already downloaded, checks segments size and if size mathces considers this 
# segment to be downloaded and skips downloading process.
# - If resume_on set to 0:
# Segget always starts new fetch for a segment regardless of the fact whether it
# is downloaded or not.
# Default:
# resume_on=1
resume_on=1

# MAX_TRIES
# If segment download was unsuccessful, new attempts are made. When attempts
# number reaches max_tries, segment gets FAILED status and error logged to error_log
# Default:
# max_tries=10
max_tries=10

[connections]
# MAX_CONNECTIONS
# Define maximum number of connections
max_connections=10

# CONNECTION_TIMEOUT
# Set the number of seconds to wait while trying to connect. Use 0 to wait 
# indefinitely. Pass a long. It should contain the maximum time in seconds that 
# you allow the connection to the server to take. This only limits the connection
# phase, once it has connected, this option is of no more use. Set to zero to 
# disable connection timeout (it will then only timeout on the system's internal 
# timeouts). See also the TIMEOUT option.
# Default:
# connection_timeout=15
connection_timeout=15

# FTP_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT
# Set a timeout period (in seconds) on the amount of time that the server is 
# allowed to take in order to generate a response message for a command before the
# session is considered hung. While awaiting for a response, this value overrides 
# TIMEOUT. It is recommended that if used in conjunction with TIMEOUT, you set 
# FTP_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT to a value smaller than TIMEOUT.
# Default:
# ftp_response_timeout=180
ftp_response_timeout=180

# TIMEOUT
# maximum amount of time to download segment in seconds
# Set the maximum number of seconds for a connection to execute.
# Pass a long as parameter containing the maximum time in seconds that you allow 
# the transfer operation to take. Normally, name lookups can take a considerable 
# time and limiting operations to less than a few minutes risk aborting perfectly
# normal operations.
# Default:
# timeout=500
timeout=500

# LOW_CONNECTION_SPEED_LIMIT
# Define the low speed limit for connection. Pass a long as parameter. It 
# contains the transfer speed in bytes per second that the transfer should be 
# below during LOW_CONNECTION_SPEED_TIME seconds to consider it too slow and abort.
# Default:
# low_connection_speed_limit=1000
low_connection_speed_limit=1000

# LOW_CONNECTION_SPEED_TIME
# Pass a long as parameter. It contains the time in seconds that the transfer 
# should be below the LOW_CONNECTION_SPEED_LIMIT to consider it too slow and abort.
# Default:
# low_connection_speed_time=10
low_connection_speed_time=10

# MAX_CONNECTION_SPEED
# If a download exceeds this speed (counted in bytes per second) on cumulative 
# average during the transfer, the transfer will pause to keep the average rate 
# less than or equal to the parameter value. Defaults to unlimited speed.
# Default:
# max_connection_speed=0
max_connection_speed=0

# NOT IMPLEMENTED YET: max_total_speed=50000

# BIND INTERFACE / IP
# Pass a string as parameter. This sets the interface name to use as outgoing 
# network interface. The name can be an interface name, an IP address, or a host 
# name. No binding is set by default.
# Default:
# bind_interface=none
bind_interface=none

# BIND LOCALPORT
# Pass a long. This sets the local port number of the socket used for connection.
# This can be used in combination with BIND_INTERFACE and you are recommended to
# use BIND_LOCALPORTRANGE as well when this is set.
# Valid port numbers are 1 - 65535.

# BIND_LOCALPORTRANGE
# Pass a long. This is the number of attempts segget should make to find a 
# working local port number. It starts with the given BIND_LOCALPORT and adds 
# one to the number for each retry. Setting this to 1 or below will make segget 
# do only one try for the exact port number. Port numbers by nature are scarce 
# resources that will be busy at times so setting this value to something too 
# low might cause unnecessary connection setup failures. 

[mirrors]
# MAX_CONNECTIONS_NUM_PER_MIRROR
# Define how many simultaneous downloads from one mirror segget is allowed to 
# have. While choosing a mirror segget will skip mirrors with 
# max_connections_num_per_mirror active downloads.
# Default:
# max_connections_num_per_mirror=1
max_connections_num_per_mirror=1

# SYNOPSIS: collect_benchmark_stats_on=0 | 1
# - If set to 1, stats on mirrors performance will be collected.
# default:
# collect_benchmark_stats_on=1 (Note: at the moment can NOT be changed)
collect_benchmark_stats_on=1

# SYNOPSIS: use_benchmark_stats=0 | 1
# If use_benchmark_stats=1 statistics on mirrors is used to rate them and 
# therefore improve performance.
# Default:
# use_benchmark_results=1 (Note: at the moment can NOT be changed)
use_benchmark_stats=1

# BENCHMARK_OBLIVION
# benchmark_oblivion option allows to adjust how fast segget "forgets" 
# benchmarking statistics on mirrors performance.
# Default:
# benchmark_oblivion=5
benchmark_oblivion=5

[protocols]
# SYNOPSIS: http_on=0 | 1
# Default: 
# http_on=1
# NOT IMPLEMENTED YET: http_on=1

[user-data]
# USER_AGENT
# Set the User-Agent: header in the http request sent to the remote server. 
# This can be used to fool servers or scripts.
# Default:
# user_agent=segget
user_agent=segget

# Specify the user and password for authentication on a ftp servers.
# NOT IMPLEMENTED YET: ftp-user=anonymous
# NOT IMPLEMENTED YET: ftp-password=me@mail.ru

[proxy]
# PROXY_IP_OR_NAME
# Specify a proxy to use (address and port).
# Set HTTP proxy to use. The parameter should be a string holding the proxy host
# name or dotted IP address. To specify port number in this string, 
# append :[port] to the end of the host name. The proxy string may be prefixed 
# with [protocol]:// since any such prefix will be ignored. The proxy's port 
# number may optionally be specified with the separate option. If not specified,
# by default port 1080 will be used for proxies.
# When you tell segget to use an HTTP proxy, segget will transparently convert 
# operations to HTTP even if you specify an FTP URL etc.
# Segget respects the environment variables http_proxy, ftp_proxy, all_proxy etc,
# if any of those are set. The PROXY option does however override any possibly 
# set environment variables.
# Default:
# proxy_ip_or_name=none
proxy_ip_or_name=none

# PROXY_PORT
# Set the proxy port to connect to unless it is specified in the PROXY option.
# Default:
# proxy_port=3128
proxy_port=3128

# PROXY_USER
# Set user name to use for the transfer while connecting to Proxy.
# The PROXY_USER option should be used in same way as the PROXY_PASSWORD is used.
# In order to specify the password to be used in conjunction with the user name
# use the PROXY_PASSWORD option.
# Default:
# proxy_user=none
proxy_user=none

# PROXY_PASSWORD
# Set password to use for the transfer while connecting to Proxy.
# The PROXY_PASSWORD option should be used in conjunction with the PROXY_USER 
# option.
# Default:
# proxy_password=none
proxy_password=none

# SYNOPSIS: proxy_off=0 | 1
# Setting the proxy_off=1 will explicitly disable the use of a proxy, even if 
# there is an environment variable set for it.
# Default:
# proxy_off=1
proxy_off=1
