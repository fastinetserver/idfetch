[distfiles]
# Each distfile can have only up to max_connection_num_per_distfile simultaneous
# connections.
# default:
# max_connection_num_per_distfile=3
max_connection_num_per_distfile=3

[segments]
# define maximum segment size in bytes
# default:
# max_segment_size=500000
max_segment_size=500000

# in case segment download was unsuccessful, new attempts are made. When attempts
# number reaches max_tries, segment gets FAILED status and error logged to error_log
# default:
#max_tries=30
max_tries=30

[connections]
# define maximum number of connections
max_connections=10

# Set the number of seconds to wait while trying to connect. Use 0 to wait 
# indefinitely. Pass a long. It should contain the maximum time in seconds that 
# you allow the connection to the server to take. This only limits the connection
# phase, once it has connected, this option is of no more use. Set to zero to 
# disable connection timeout (it will then only timeout on the system's internal 
# timeouts). See also the TIMEOUT option.
# default:
# connection_timeout=15
connection_timeout=15

# Set a timeout period (in seconds) on the amount of time that the server is 
# allowed to take in order to generate a response message for a command before the
# session is considered hung. While awaiting for a response, this value overrides 
# TIMEOUT. It is recommended that if used in conjunction with TIMEOUT, you set 
# FTP_RESPONSE_TIMEOUT to a value smaller than TIMEOUT.
# default:
# ftp_response_timeout=5000
ftp_response_timeout=5000

# maximum amount of time to download segment in seconds
# Set the maximum number of seconds for a connection to execute.
# Pass a long as parameter containing the maximum time in seconds that you allow 
# the transfer operation to take. Normally, name lookups can take a considerable 
# time and limiting operations to less than a few minutes risk aborting perfectly
# normal operations.
# default:
# timeout=6000
timeout=6000

# LOW_CONNECTION_SPEED_LIMIT
# Define the low speed limit for connection. Pass a long as parameter. It 
# contains the transfer speed in bytes per second that the transfer should be 
# below during LOW_CONNECTION_SPEED_TIME seconds to consider it too slow and abort.
# default:
# low_connection_speed_limit=1000
low_connection_speed_limit=1000

# LOW_CONNECTION_SPEED_TIME
# Pass a long as parameter. It contains the time in seconds that the transfer 
# should be below the LOW_CONNECTION_SPEED_LIMIT to consider it too slow and abort.
# default:
# low_connection_speed_time=10
low_connection_speed_time=10

# MAX_CONNECTION_SPEED
# If a download exceeds this speed (counted in bytes per second) on cumulative 
# average during the transfer, the transfer will pause to keep the average rate 
# less than or equal to the parameter value. Defaults to unlimited speed.
# default:
# max_connection_speed=0
max_connection_speed=0

#max_total_speed=50000

# BIND INTERFACE / IP
# Pass a string as parameter. This sets the interface name to use as outgoing 
# network interface. The name can be an interface name, an IP address, or a host 
# name. No binding is set by default.
# default:
# bind_interface=none
bind_interface=none

# BIND LOCALPORT
# Pass a long. This sets the local port number of the socket used for connection.
# This can be used in combination with BIND_INTERFACE and you are recommended to
# use BIND_LOCALPORTRANGE as well when this is set.
# Valid port numbers are 1 - 65535.

# BIND_LOCALPORTRANGE
# Pass a long. This is the number of attempts segget should make to find a 
# working local port number. It starts with the given BIND_LOCALPORT and adds 
# one to the number for each retry. Setting this to 1 or below will make segget 
# do only one try for the exact port number. Port numbers by nature are scarce 
# resources that will be busy at times so setting this value to something too 
# low might cause unnecessary connection setup failures.
